    Weekdays on which the NYSE is closed (full-day holidays and one-off

    Computed as all weekdays between the calendar's first and last session

    20 years through about one year ahead; outside that range no holidays
    are known and every weekday is treated as a trading day. Early-close
    (half) days are trading sessions and are not included. The result is
