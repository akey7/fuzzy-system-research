"""
The portfolio optimization problem, defined once: the assets, the daily
return estimates, the risk-free rate, the constraint set, and how a
portfolio's return, risk, and Sharpe ratio are computed and annualized.

Every optimization and every reported point uses this module, so the
optimizer, the efficient frontier, the random portfolios, and every
coordinate written to portfolio_optimization_plot_data.h5 and
optimization_metadata.yml share one definition and cannot drift apart:

- PortfolioProblem.bounds() and constraints() are the constraint set of the
  max Sharpe ratio, minimum variance, maximum return, and efficient-frontier
  optimizations (see portfolio.py).
- PortfolioProblem.daily_mean_return() and daily_variance() are the only
  implementations of w·μ and wᵀΣw. The optimizers' objectives use them, and
  so does portfolio_stats().
- PortfolioProblem.portfolio_stats() is the only place that turns weights
  into the annualized return, risk, and Sharpe ratio that are uploaded.
- PortfolioProblem.sample_feasible_weights() draws random portfolios from
  the same constraint set.

Conventions:
- Returns are simple daily returns of adjusted closes, in percent. The mean
  vector and the sample covariance matrix (ddof = 1) are estimated from the
  prices given to from_prices() (about one year of daily data in the
  pipeline), so they are noisy.
- The risk-free rate is daily, in percent (the annual 3-month T-bill rate /
  TRADING_DAYS_PER_YEAR).
- Annualization is arithmetic: return × 252 and risk × √252, so the
  annualized Sharpe ratio, (annual return − annual risk-free rate) / annual
  risk, equals the daily Sharpe ratio × √252.
- Constraints: long-only (each weight ≥ 0), fully invested (weights sum to
  1), and each weight at most weight_cap_multiple / (number of assets). The
  multiple is a setting in config/modeling_and_optimization.yml.

Pure computation: no file or network I/O.
