"""
Walk-forward backtest of the max Sharpe ratio portfolio against an equally
weighted baseline, over the most recent scored trading days, plus writers
for the two files the frontend reads (see docs/INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md).

With t the last session, E scored days, T training returns, and a rebalance
every R sessions:

- The rebalance dates are t-E, t-E+R, ..., t-R, so there are E / R of them,
  and there is no rebalance at t.
- At the close of each rebalance date, the max Sharpe ratio weights are
  estimated from the T daily returns ending on that date (T + 1 closes), with
  the last DTB3 rate published on an earlier date. PortfolioProblem receives
  only that slice of prices, so nothing after the rebalance date can reach
  the estimates or the weights.
- Each portfolio moves to its target weights and is held for R sessions, with
  no trading, so its weights drift with the assets' returns. The baseline
  moves back to 1 / n each on the same dates.
- Wealth starts at $1.00 at the close of t-E and compounds the E daily
  portfolio returns, giving E + 1 observations.

Conventions:
- The window lengths come from config/modeling_and_optimization.yml.
- Returns are simple daily returns of adjusted closes. They are fractions in
  this module's results and percent in the written files. Massive.com's
  adjusted closes are not assumed to include dividends, so these may be price
  returns rather than total returns.
- Constraints: the same PortfolioProblem as the live optimization (long-only,
  fully invested, each weight capped). They apply to target weights only;
  drifted weights can exceed the cap between rebalances.
- CAGR is compounded, unlike the arithmetic annualization of
  optimization_metadata.yml: (end wealth)^(252 / E) - 1. It extrapolates a
  short window to a full year, so it is noisy.
- Execution is idealized: rebalancing happens exactly at the close whose
  price the optimization has just used, with no transaction costs or
  slippage. This is not an execution-realistic trading simulation, and the
  universe of tickers is fixed and was chosen with hindsight.
- Fallback: if an optimization does not converge, or its weights violate the
  constraints, the portfolio rebalances back to the previous target weights
  (equal weights for the first rebalance), which use only earlier information
  and are always feasible. Each rebalance records its status.

check_backtest_prices() rejects missing data before anything is computed, and
check_backtest_invariants() and verify_backtest_files() raise InvariantError,
so a failed check stops the run before anything is uploaded.
