        The prices in original_ts are converted to log returns by
        to_log_returns(), the only differencing step, before fitting. The
        selected model is the one already fit during selection; it is not

        Sets the instance attributes train_result (see train_arima()),
        final_model (the selected fitted model), and order_tie_broken
        (whether select_order() needed its tie-break rules; see
        order_was_tie_broken()).

        This assumes one index entry per NYSE trading session (as produced

            The original time series (prices) of the training window.

        Returns

        tuple[pd.Timestamp, float, tuple[int, int]]
            The date being forecast (the next NYSE trading day after the
