# Installation

## Package Management

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python versions, virtual environments, and dependencies. Install `uv` first (for example, `brew install uv` on macOS). Dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml`, and `uv.lock` pins the exact versions that were resolved. The project requires Python 3.13 and pins 3.13.5 in `.python-version`, which `uv` downloads automatically if it is not already installed.

### Development Dependencies

Create the `.venv` virtual environment and install production plus development dependencies (the `dev` group is included by default). This also installs the `fuzzy_system_research` package from `src/` in editable mode, so edits to the library code take effect immediately:

```
uv sync
```

### Production Dependencies

To install only the production dependencies:

```
uv sync --no-dev
```

### Running the backend

One command runs everything: it downloads prices (or reuses today's cached download), fits the walk-forward ARIMA forecasts (or reuses the cached forecasts for the data's as-of date), optimizes the portfolio, and uploads all results for the frontend. Run it through `uv` so it uses the project environment; there is no need to activate the virtual environment manually:

```
uv run python scripts/run_optimization_and_time_series.py
```

Options:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--no-upload` | Write the `output/` files but upload nothing. Use this to check a run without touching any bucket. |
| `--retrain-arima` | Retrain the ARIMA models even if forecasts for the as-of date are cached. |
| `--refresh-data` | Download prices again even if today's download is cached. |
| `--workers N` | Number of worker processes for ARIMA training. Defaults to half the logical CPUs (for example 8 on a 16-thread Intel CPU, 5 on a 10-core M4). `--workers 1` trains everything in one process. The forecasts do not depend on this setting. |
| `--config PATH` | Model settings file to use instead of `config/modeling_and_optimization.yml` (see below). |

Nothing is uploaded unless every step succeeds. If a later step fails, the ARIMA forecasts already written to `output/` are reused on the next run.

Always run scripts from the repository root, because the scripts read and write `input/` and `output/` (and read `config/`) relative to the current working directory.

### Model settings

Time series settings live in `config/modeling_and_optimization.yml`, which is checked into the repository. **For the current values, and what each setting means, consult that file's comments;** the validation rules (types and minimums) are documented in `src/fuzzy_system_research/config.py`. This document deliberately does not repeat the values, so it cannot go out of date when they change.

```yaml
time_series_models:
  training_window_length: ...    # closes (trading sessions) per ARIMA training window
  evaluation_window_length: ...  # most recent trading days backtested and scored
```

- `training_window_length` counts **closing prices**; each window has one fewer daily log return than closes.
- `evaluation_window_length` is the number of backtest days in `all_forecasts.csv` (plus the live forecast) and in the metrics of `all_forecasts_metadata.yml`.
- Both keys are required, and unknown keys are rejected, so a typo stops the run before any download instead of silently using a default.
- The run downloads enough history for the ARIMA windows plus scored days and for the optimization's 252 sessions, whichever is longer, with a small margin.
- Each run records the values it used in `all_forecasts_metadata.yml` (`forecast_window.training_window_returns`, `evaluation_window.target_trading_days`), which is where the frontend reads them.

Changing a value changes what is uploaded. Run with `--retrain-arima` afterwards, because the cached forecasts for a date are otherwise reused. `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` does not state the values, so changing them needs no contract update as long as their meaning stays the same.

### Running the tests

The tests in `tests/` run in memory: they use mocks and temporary directories, and never touch the network, the bucket, `input/`, or `output/`. Run them from the repository root:

```
uv run pytest
```

Run other development tools the same way, for example `uv run black .`.

### Managing dependencies

```
uv add <package>           # add a production dependency
uv add --dev <package>     # add a development dependency
uv remove <package>        # remove a dependency
uv lock --upgrade          # upgrade all packages within the declared constraints
uv sync                    # bring .venv in line with uv.lock
```

Commit both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` whenever dependencies change.

### `.env` file

**Never commit the `.env` file to GitHub!** It should never be made publicly accessible because it contains API keys.

Here are the keys the scripts need to function:

1. `MASSIVE_API_KEY`: Key to Massive.com API for stock and index data. Obtain from API provider.

2. `FSF_FRONT_END_BUCKET_REGION`, `FSF_FRONT_END_BUCKET_RWDELETE`, `FSF_FRONT_END_BUCKET_KEY_ID`, `FSF_FRONT_END_BUCKET_ENDPOINT`: Region, read/write/delete key, key id, and endpoint of the DigitalOcean S3/Spaces bucket. Set as appropriate for development or production environments. Obtain values from DigitalOcean or AWS environments.

3. `FSF_FRONT_END_BUCKET_NAME`: Name of the one DigitalOcean Space (S3 bucket) that holds all frontend data. `FSF_FRONT_END_BUCKET_ENDPOINT` must be the region-only endpoint (e.g. `https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com`) without the Space name; the uploader refuses to run otherwise.

4. `FSF_FRONT_END_PORTFOLIO_OPTIMIZATION_FOLDER` and `FSF_FRONT_END_TIME_SERIES_FOLDER`: names of the two top-level folders inside that Space, holding the portfolio optimization and ARIMA time series data. Dev and production share the Space and use different folder names. Files are uploaded to `<folder>/YYYY-MM-DD/<file>`; see `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` for the full key layout.

Items 2 through 4 connect the backend to the front end.

## Execution

Once setup is complete, run the whole pipeline from the repository root as described in [Running the backend](#running-the-backend).
