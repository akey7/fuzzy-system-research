# System Design

This document describes the system design of the backend.

Also of interest to an engineering audience is the [INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md](INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md) file, which describes the contract of data transmission from the backend to the frontend.

## How the backend works

One run of `scripts/run_optimization_and_time_series.py` downloads prices, then follows two paths, the time series forecasts and the portfolio optimization, and finally uploads their results. The first diagram shows which module owns each part of a run; the second shows which files each step reads and writes, and the functions that write them.

## From data sources to upload

```

- The two paths run one after the other in a single process. Within the time series path, the ARIMA fits for every ticker and day run at the same time in a pool of worker processes (`--workers`).
- The ARIMA window, the number of scored days, and the optimization's weight cap, plot array lengths, and random seed come from the configuration file (see "Model settings" in [INSTALLATION_AND_EXECUTION.md](INSTALLATION_AND_EXECUTION.md#model-settings)); the optimization window is set in `pipeline.py`.
- The optimization has one definition, `PortfolioProblem` in `optimization/problem.py`. Its constraint set is used by every optimizer and by the random portfolios, and its `portfolio_stats()` computes every return, risk, and Sharpe ratio that is uploaded, so the plot cannot drift from the optimization. `workflow.py` checks the invariants (see its `check_optimization_invariants()`) before the files are written, then reads both written files back and checks that they agree.
- Nothing is uploaded unless every step succeeds, including those checks.

```

The local folders mirror the bucket keys (`storage/layout.py` builds both), so each local date folder maps to the same date folder in the Space. `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` describes what each uploaded file contains.

## Project structure

The repository separates code that you **run** from code that you **import**:

```

Scripts contain argument handling and orchestration: they decide *what* to run. The package contains the computation and I/O helpers: it knows *how*. Scripts import from the package (for example, `from fuzzy_system_research.pipeline import run_pipeline`), and the package never imports from `scripts/`. This keeps the quantitative code importable and testable without triggering a download or an upload.

### Data folders

The backend uses the following folders. You don't need to create them: the scripts create each one (and any missing parent folders) the first time they write to it. Their content is not committed to GitHub.

1. `input/`: Holds risk free rate data.

2. `input/annual/`: Holds the cached price downloads (one file per run date), long enough for both the optimization and the ARIMA forecasts. The optimization uses the last 252 trading days, and ARIMA the last training window plus scored backtest days (see "Model settings" in [INSTALLATION_AND_EXECUTION.md](INSTALLATION_AND_EXECUTION.md#model-settings) for where those lengths are set). A cached file that is too short, for example one written before the ARIMA window grew, is downloaded again automatically.

3. `output/`: Holds the results of runs, in one folder per data as-of date (the last NYSE trading day in the run's data). Subfolders are created automatically. The layout mirrors the frontend buckets, where each file's key is its path below `output/<kind>/`:

   ```
   output/portfolio_optimization/YYYY-MM-DD/optimization_metadata.yml
   output/portfolio_optimization/YYYY-MM-DD/portfolio_optimization_plot_data.h5
   output/time_series/YYYY-MM-DD/all_forecasts.csv
   output/time_series/YYYY-MM-DD/all_forecasts_metadata.yml
   ```

   Re-running for the same date overwrites that date's files, except that ARIMA training is skipped when that date's `all_forecasts.csv` already exists (unless `--retrain-arima` is given). See `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` for the bucket layout the frontend reads.

An older `input/monthly/` folder, if present, is no longer used and can be deleted.

### Scripts

Run these directly with `uv run python scripts/<filename>` from the repository root.

| Filename                                | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Uploads to front end? |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `scripts/run_optimization_and_time_series.py` | The whole backend in one run: obtain adjusted close prices, fit walk-forward ARIMA forecasts, compute max Sharpe ratio and min variance portfolios, the efficient frontier, and a Monte Carlo simulation, then upload. See "Running the backend" in [INSTALLATION_AND_EXECUTION.md](INSTALLATION_AND_EXECUTION.md#running-the-backend) for flags. | Yes |
| `scripts/ticker_download_to_csv.py`     | Download a supported symbol from Massive.com and put the results into a `.csv` file. Usage: `uv run python scripts/ticker_download_to_csv.py <ticker> <date_from> <date_to> <filename>`.                                    | No                    |

### Library modules

These modules are imported by the scripts and are not meant to be executed directly.

| Module (under `src/fuzzy_system_research/`) | Purpose                                                                                                                                                 | Uploads to front end?                |

| `data/date_manager.py`                      | Date and business day calculations on the NYSE trading calendar (via `exchange_calendars`).                                                             | No                                   |
| `data/prices.py`                            | Pivots downloaded prices to a wide table and selects the most recent trading sessions.                                                                 | No                                   |
| `optimization/problem.py`                   | `PortfolioProblem`, the one definition of the optimization: mean and covariance estimates, risk-free rate, the constraint set (`bounds()`, `constraints()`: long-only, sum to 1, configurable cap), `portfolio_stats()` (every uploaded return, risk, and Sharpe ratio), a seeded sampler of feasible random portfolios, and the annualization helpers. | No |
| `optimization/portfolio.py`                 | Max Sharpe ratio, minimum variance, and maximum return optimizations under the shared constraints (raising `OptimizationError` if one does not converge), the efficient frontier (unreachable targets become `NaN`), and risk-free rate retrieval. | No |
| `optimization/workflow.py`                  | One full optimization run from prices to annualized results, all from one `PortfolioProblem`: the capital allocation line, the invariant checks (`InvariantError`), the `.h5` and `.yml` writers, and a read-back check that the two files agree. The `.yml` holds the weights of both the max Sharpe ratio and the minimum variance portfolios, with a comment marking `optimum_portfolio` as the max Sharpe ratio portfolio. | No |

| `forecasting/metrics.py`                    | Accuracy of the ARIMA and naive forecasts over the configured number of most recent trading days (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, relative MAE, skill, directional accuracy) for `all_forecasts_metadata.yml`. | No |
| `pipeline.py`                               | Orchestrates one backend run and its uploads (`all_forecasts.csv`, `all_forecasts_metadata.yml`, `.h5`, then `optimization_metadata.yml` last).      | Yes                                  |
| `storage/layout.py`                         | Builds the dated `output/` paths and matching bucket keys (`<folder>/YYYY-MM-DD/<file>`).                                                               | No                                   |
